                Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?

                Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. Why do you hurt me, Michael? I've always been loyal to you. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing. Don't you contact me again, ever. From now on, you deal with Turnbull.

                I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! Te salut, Don Corleone. It's not personal. It's business. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Don't ever give an order like that again. Not while I'm alive.

                Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? Hey, listen, I want somebody good - and I mean very good - to plant that gun. I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright? I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out.

                It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men. That's my family Kay, that's not me. Friends and money - oil and water. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

                I am sorry. What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Your enemies always get strong on what you leave behind. Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you.

                If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.

                Never hate your enemies. It affects your judgment. Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. What's the matter with you, huh? What am I going to do? Am I going to make that baby an orphan before he's born? Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child.
